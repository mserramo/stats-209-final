This project was done for the course STATS 209 "Causal Inference" at Stanford University. We re-analyzed a study from the 1990s on the effect of flu shots on hospitalization that had incorrectly used an instrumental variables (IV) approach in the presence of violations of the exclusion restriction assumption. We avoid this problem by re-framing the study as observation and using a matching estimator and inverse propensity score weighting estimators.
